# E-Commerce-Shop

Introducing my e-commerce project, built with Spring Boot and following a microservice architecture. This cutting-edge system comprises three key microservices: Wallet Service, Inventory Service, and Shop Service. Each microservice operates with its own dedicated database, facilitating independent management and scalability. 

To ensure seamless communication and interoperability, these microservices interact with each other via a REST API, leveraging the power of Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, Spring Web, OpenAPI, and Circuit Breaker. 

One of the standout features of our e-commerce project is the utilization of a remote configuration server. This innovative approach allows each microservice to dynamically retrieve its configurations from a centralized location, ensuring easy configuration management and flexibility across the system. 

Furthermore, we have incorporated a gateway server, which acts as a single entry point for all incoming requests. This gateway server provides essential functionalities such as request routing, load balancing, and security enforcement, enhancing the overall performance and reliability of the e-commerce platform. 

Our e-commerce project built with Spring Boot and microservice architecture offers exceptional scalability, fault tolerance, and flexibility. By leveraging the power of Spring technologies and adhering to best practices, we have created a robust and efficient system that can handle the complexities of modern e-commerce operations. Experience the future of online shopping with our innovative solution.
